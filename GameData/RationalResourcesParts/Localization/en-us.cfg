        #RR_Parts_Boxblue_title = RR Boxed Radial Convert-O-Tron A
        #RR_Parts_Boxblue_desc = A variable box frame containing a multi-purpose converter unit with several advanced options...in addition to the basic LFO option for prospective buyers. It operates at 60% the capacity of Kerbodyne's leading product.
        
        #RR_Parts_Boxblue_flat_title = RR Boxed Compressor
        #RR_Parts_Boxblue_flat_desc = A variable box frame containing a multi-purpose converter unit with several advanced options focused on cryogenics. It packs impressive power for its size. It may demand impressive power too, actually.
        
        #RR_Parts_Boxblue_long_title = RR Boxed Radial Convert-O-Tron B
        #RR_Parts_Boxblue_long_desc = A variable box frame containing a multi-purpose converter unit with several advanced options...in addition to the basic LFO option for prospective buyers. It operates at 100% the capacity of Kerbodyne's leading product.
        
        #RR_Parts_BreadTank04_title = RR Bread Tank 04
        #RR_Parts_BreadTank04_desc = Temporary part provided by Rational Resources. Holds all major resources (The remaining resource options are in the stock Ore tanks). Will replace very soon.
        
        #RR_Parts_BreadTank12_title = RR Bread Tank 12
        #RR_Parts_BreadTank12_desc = Temporary part provided by Rational Resources. Holds all major resources (The remaining resource options are in the stock Ore tanks). Will replace very soon.
        
        #RR_Parts_BreadTank11_title = RR Bread Tank 11
        #RR_Parts_BreadTank11_desc = Temporary part provided by Rational Resources. Holds all major resources (The remaining resource options are in the stock Ore tanks). Will replace very soon.
        
        #RR_Parts_EngineMET_title = RR MET
        #RR_Parts_EngineMET_desc = This Microwave Electrothermal Thruster arises out of the further need for high-impulse engines that can burn water. Between water bottle rocketry and a microwave oven's ability to boil water, sparks flew, and something had to happen... There's the little matter of the microwave itself generating a lot of heat so be sure to take care of that, okay?
        
        #RR_Parts_EngineNTJ1_title = RR J-406 "Maine Coon" Nuclear Thermal Turbojet
        #RR_Parts_EngineNTJ1_desc = In the spirit of feline themed aircraft propulsion, Kenron's engineers sought out a rare, spotted or striped breed to use as the namesake for what would be to them, the pinnacle of off-world aircraft propulsion. While somewhat fussy and prone to push too hard and overheat itself, the Main Coon is high spec and able to provide cruising speeds near Mach 3. Its built-in reactor replaces the conventional combustion chamber and is a great alternative to fuel cells on a long night... This breed totally was not chosen because similar somehow escaped from its owner, nested in the prototype and nearly got itself cooked.
        
        #RR_Parts_EngineNERVA-R_title = RR LV-N-R Nuclear Thermal Rocket
        #RR_Parts_EngineNERVA-R_desc = R for "Reducing," this advanced form of the classic NERV engine, the LV-N-R is able to safely operate on any of a small number of "reducing" propellants, namely Hydrogen, Ammonia, and Methane. The average Isp of its propellant options is high, keeping this engine most suited for use on lightweight and far-travelling craft.
        
        #RR_Parts_EngineNERVA-O_title = RR LV-N-O Nuclear Thermal Rocket
        #RR_Parts_EngineNERVA-O_desc = O for "Oxidizing," this advanced form of the classic NERV engine, the LV-N-O is able to safely operate on any of a small number of "oxidizing" propellants, namely Carbon Dioxide and Water. The average Isp of its propellant options is low, making this engine most suited for use on heavyweight and short range craft.
        
        #RR_Parts_EngineSRB_RT05_title = RR Hybrid SRM RT-5 "Flea"
        #RR_Parts_EngineSRB_RT05_desc = This specialty-made solid rocket holds its fuel in the form of one of any highly reactive alkali Metals, printed and woven into a self-supporting structure within the engine casing, and recieves its Oxidizer in liquid form like any bipropellant engine. Due to this, it can be throttled and restarted, and the metal's highly reactive nature grants a notable boost in impulse.
        
        #RR_Parts_engineSRB_RT10_title = RR Hybrid SRM RT-10 "Hammer"
        #RR_Parts_engineSRB_RT10_desc = This specialty-made solid rocket holds its fuel in the form of one of any highly reactive alkali Metals, printed and woven into a self-supporting structure within the engine casing, and recieves its Oxidizer in liquid form like any bipropellant engine. Due to this, it can be throttled and restarted, and the metal's highly reactive nature grants a notable boost in impulse.
        
        #RR_Parts_Exoscoop_title = RR Particle Scoop
        #RR_Parts_Exoscoop_desc = Apparently someone went wild with a very large heap of discarded laundry baskets and a shed load of Copper wire. This device can generate a conical magnetic field modestly larger than its physical frame, enabling effective uptake of gaseous particles into the filtration system which then leads to the best part... refilling the tank.

        //Resources
